1,"For the 1990 estimates, please see  table 25-10-0008."
2,"Coal includes the following coal types: bituminous, sub-bituminous, lignite and anthracite."
3,"Coal coke is a hard, porous product made from baking bituminous coal in ovens at high temperatures. Often used as a fuel and a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace."
4,"Coke oven gas is the difference between the thermal value of coal charged to coke ovens less the thermal value of the resultant coke production, with an allowance for heating and losses."
5,"Electricity is a form of energy emanating from electric charges at rest or in movement."
6,"Heavy fuel oil is all grades of residual type fuels including low sulphur. Usually used for steam and electric power generation and diesel motors. Includes fuel oil numbers 4, 5 and 6."
7,"Middle distillates includes light fuel oil (numbers 1, 2 and 3), kerosene, mineral lamp oil, stove oil, furnace fuel oil, gas oils diesel and light industrial fuel. Does not include gasoline used for transportation off the plant site."
8,"Natural gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons (principally methane) and small quantities of various hydrocarbons existing in the gaseous phase or in solution with crude oil in underground reservoirs."
9,"Petroleum coke is a residue that is the final product in the condensation process in cracking. Includes pitch coke on catalytic cracking catalyst which is coke produced from the refining process of breaking down the larger, heavier, and more complex hydrocarbon molecules into simpler and lighter molecules."
10,"Propane is a normally gaseous straight-chain hydrocarbon (C3H8) extracted from natural gas or refinery gas streams. It can also take a liquid form."
11,"Refinery fuel gas is the remaining unseparated gaseous fractions produced in refinery distillation or cracking processes, after marketable products have been extracted, usually consumed as refinery fuel. It is also known as still gas."
12,"Spent pulping liquor is a by-product of the paper making process containing carbohydrate and lignin decomposition products. Also known as black liquor."
13,"Steam is a gas resulting from the vaporization of a liquid or the sublimation of a solid, generated by condensing or noncondensing turbines. The steam consumed is purchased (received by the establishment)."
14,"Wood is wood and wood energy used as fuel, including round wood (cord wood), lignin, wood scraps from furniture and window frame manufacturing, wood chips, bark, sawdust, forest residues, charcoal and pulp waste."
15,"This combines the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes 325130 and 3259.
"
16,"Totals may not add due to rounding."
17,"The coefficient of variation (CV) is an estimate used to express the sampling variance (or sampling error) of the estimate. Generally, the more commonly reported variables obtained very good CVs (of less than 10%), while the less commonly reported variables were associated with higher but still acceptable CVs (under 25%). The qualities of CVs are rated as follows: A - Excellent (CV between 0.01% to 4.9%); B - Very good (CV between 5.0% to 9.9%); C - Good (CV between 10.0% to 14.9%); D - Acceptable (CV between 15.0% to 24.9%); E - Use with caution (CV between 25.0% to 34.9%); F - Too unreliable to be published (CV greater than or equal to 35.0%)."
18,"Totals may include confidential data not published."
19,"Butane is a gaseous hydrocarbon extracted from natural gas or refinery gas streams. Primarily used for blending in high-octane gasoline, for residential and commercial heating, and in the manufacture of chemicals and synthetic rubber."
20,"As of 2013 the factor used to convert the refinery fuel gas estimates into gigajoules from natural units was revised to 36.08 from 42.5."
21,"Estimates for the most recent year are preliminary.  Preliminary data are subject to revision."
