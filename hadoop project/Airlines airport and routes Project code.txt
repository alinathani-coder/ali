#Airlines, airports and routes Project
#Data source downloaded from https://openflights.org/data.html
#3 files downloaded, airports.dat, routes.dat and airlines.dat

#Step 1. Preparing the folders for importing data
#In HortonWorks and connected via Putty.exe within the Linux box (Sandbox), use following code to open the home directory and make a folder within the lab folder

cd /home
cd lab 
mkdir project

#Step 2. Using FileZilla Site Manager, transfer the .dat files to the project folder
#Step 3. make an hdfs project folder (if doesn't already exist) using the following code from within the Linux box (Sandbox)

hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/project

#Step 4. transfer the files from the local Linux box to HDFS
#first open the project folder on local box

cd project 

#then transfer all files (specify file names instead of * if you want to do 1 at a time) to the HDFS box

hdfs dfs -put * /user/project

#Step 5. Run the Pig tool and start loading the data into a variable, defining the variables accordingly

#Q1 FIRST 5 AIRLINES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER
a = load '/user/project/airlines.dat' USING PigStorage(',') AS (airline_id:long, name:chararray, alias:chararray, IATA:chararray, ICAO:chararray, callsign:chararray, country:chararray, active:chararray);

#Run the following code to list the distinct airlines:

b = foreach a generate airline_id, LOWER(name) as name;

c = distinct b;
d = limit c 5; #will list the top/first 5 in the list

STORE d into '/user/project/distinct_airlines' using PigStorage('\t') ;

#to check the temp file name created for the output
fs -ls /user/project/distinct_airlines; 

#to get the output printed on screen instead of using the Dump command which also shows all codes
